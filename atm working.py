'''You task is to replicate the working of ATM for a single user, letâ€™s say,
 Mr. John, who has already successfully logged into her account on the ATM Machine, now,
 we will program the next steps he may want to perform. 
Like display his name and cash available in his savings account
Withdraw cash and display the status of the cash balance.
Deposit cash and display the status of the cash balance.
(Your task is to design and implement the ATM functionality by taking care of all constraints,
 for example if minimum cash available is less than 5000 then system will display low balance)'''
